Introduction
------------

This University Database System is a simple database using OOP which allows 
the storage of new incoming students (undergraduate students) to the university as well as the 
retrieval of a student's data once saved. The constraint on student capacity is 10. In order to 
retrieve a student, the full name has to be entered, and the "Display Information" button clicked.
